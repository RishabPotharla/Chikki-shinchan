    <h3>ABOUT:-</h3>
    <p>
      Her name was <em>Chikki</em> ( that's what one of her friend and I call ) but everyone just called her <strong>Chinese</strong>. She was a natural <em>beauty</em>
      and not like <strong>other</strong> girls. She had black hair with <em>hair-puff </em> and her skin was like a <em> cup of coffee that was mostly Milk</em> because she was <strong>White</strong>.
      She didn't need to wear alot of <em>Make-up</em> like the <strong>other</strong> girls but she use <a href="https://www.maccosmetics.in/products/13854/products/makeup/lips/lipstick"><em>MAC lipstick</em> </a> on her <strong>lips</strong>. She wore <em>Jackets, Croptops and Trousers</em> because <strong> Saree</strong>
      requires grace and all that doesn't suit her. She eats snowman <em>DOSA</em> because she is the <strong>inventor</strong> of it. She was just <strong>UNIQUE</strong> like that. She uses a <em>strategy</em> to cut her hair or eye-brows thats her <strong>aunts</strong>.
      It was fine she look <em>good</em> but her <strong>hair-puff</strong> is something else. Not a single person noticed <em>her Index finger and her middle finger </em> of her right hand is almost same size except for <strong>Me</strong>. I noticed <em>her</em> because she is <strong>different</strong>.
